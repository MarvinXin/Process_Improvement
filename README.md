🧪 Process Improvement: Bottle Cap Manufacturing Simulation
This personal project simulates a bottle cap manufacturing process to help identify and fix inefficiencies. It’s designed to explore how process simulation and data dashboards can be used to support continuous improvement in a production environment.

🎯 Project Goal
The main goal is to:

Simulate different steps in the bottle cap manufacturing process

Identify inefficiencies and forms of waste (e.g., downtime, overproduction, defects)

Use statistical process control (SPC) tools to monitor performance

Suggest improvements to stabilize and optimize the process

🛠️ Tools Used
Python – Main programming language

SimPy – To simulate real-world factory behavior and process flow

Pandas / Numpy – For data handling and analysis

Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly – For data visualization

Dash / Streamlit – To build an interactive SPC dashboard

📊 What the Simulation Tracks
Production cycle time

Machine downtime

Defect rates

Bottlenecks

SPC metrics (e.g., control limits, variation over time)

🧩 Outcome
The simulation provides insights into how the production line behaves under different conditions. The dashboard helps visualize:

When the process is going out of control

Where improvements can be made

How to apply controls to stabilize quality
