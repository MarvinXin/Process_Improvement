# Process_Improvement
This is a personal project to help simulate and improve any inefficiencies during any type of process.

Goal:
The main goal is to simulate different processes and find and fix waste and inefficiencies within the process.

1. Using things like SimPy + Python to be able to simulate the different results
2. Get information from the Simulation and create an SPC Dashboard to track all of the different process efficiency.
3. Find solutions that can help remove and create a control within the different SPC metrics.
